# Stock Market Prediction Dashboard üìâ

## Overview
The **Stock Market Prediction Dashboard** is a machine learning project designed to predict future stock prices based on historical data and sentiment analysis of relevant news and social media trends. The model uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for time series forecasting and provides a user-friendly dashboard built with **Streamlit** to interact with the predictions.

This project aims to provide investors with actionable insights based on both quantitative stock data and qualitative sentiment trends.

## Features üöÄ
- **Real-time Stock Data Acquisition:** Fetches real-time stock data using the **yfinance** API.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:** Scales stock price data and incorporates sentiment scores.
- **Modeling:** Trains an **LSTM** model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrates sentiment scores from news headlines and tweets to improve predictions.
- **Streamlit Dashboard:** Interactive web app to enter a stock ticker and visualize predicted stock prices.

## Technologies Used üõ†
- **Python**
**TensorFlow/Keras** (for building the LSTM model)
- **Streamlit** (for the interactive web dashboard)
- **yfinance** (for real-time stock data acquisition)
- **NLTK & VaderSentiment** (for sentiment analysis on financial news/tweets)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation and preprocessing)
- **Scikit-learn** (for scaling and machine learning tasks)
  
## Setup & Installation üíª
### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction-dashboard.git
cd stock-market-prediction-dashboard
```
## Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## Model Description üß†
- The LSTM model is designed to predict future stock prices based on historical closing prices. Sentiment scores are integrated as an additional feature, which are calculated using sentiment analysis techniques on financial news and tweets related to the stock.
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is used due to its ability to model time series data with long-term dependencies, making it well-suited for financial forecasting.
  
## Sample Output üìä
Upon entering a stock ticker, the app will display:
- Historical stock data (opening, closing prices)
- Predicted stock price for the next day/week/month
- Sentiment analysis scores that may impact the stock's movement

## Challenges & Future Improvements üöß
While the model provides valuable insights, there are several areas for improvement:
- Accuracy: Model accuracy can be further improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters and incorporating additional features like market indicators.
- Sentiment Analysis: More sophisticated sentiment analysis using deep learning models can provide deeper insights into market psychology.
- Model Deployment: We can deploy the app as a cloud service (e.g., on AWS or Heroku) for wider accessibility.
